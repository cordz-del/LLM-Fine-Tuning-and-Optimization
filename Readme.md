# LLM Fine-Tuning and Optimization Repository

This repository demonstrates advanced techniques for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to optimize their performance for specific tasks. It highlights methods for training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation using open-source frameworks. This work underscores my ability to enhance AI systems for production, a key requirement for the AI Engineering Lead role.

## Overview

The LLM Fine-Tuning and Optimization Repository is designed to showcase:
- **Fine-Tuning Techniques:** Customized training of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-2, or similar open-source models) on domain-specific datasets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Methods to optimize training parameters for improved accuracy and efficiency.
- **Model Evaluation:** Metrics and evaluation strategies that ensure the fine-tuned models meet production-grade performance standards.
- **Real-World Impact:** By tailoring models for specific tasks (such as conversational AI for SEL or cybersecurity alert analysis), this repository demonstrates how fine-tuning can lead to more accurate and contextually aware AI systems.

## Features

- **Customized Training Pipelines:**  
  Scripts to preprocess data, fine-tune models, and save optimized checkpoints.

- **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  
  Tools and methods (such as grid search or Bayesian optimization) to tune model parameters.

- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Code to evaluate model performance using accuracy, F1-score, token efficiency, and response latency.

- **Integration with Cloud Tools:**  
  Examples on how to deploy and monitor fine-tuned models in production environments.

## Architecture

The system is divided into three main layers:
1. **Data & Preprocessing Layer:**  
   Handles dataset curation, cleaning, and tokenization.
2. **Training & Optimization Layer:**  
   Fine-tunes the base LLM using custom training loops and hyperparameter tuning.
3. **Evaluation & Deployment Layer:**  
   Evaluates model performance and integrates with deployment pipelines for production usage.
